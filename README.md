# Running Text

The task is to create an application using `HTML` , `CSS` and `Javascript` Which Renders the text 
**We love Programming!**
but we also have a input fom 1 to 10 where it basically represents that the per character of this text is going to be rendered with the speed of **500/`{input_number}`** ms so if the input is 1 this means that character will be running/rendering with speed of 500 ms per character and if the speed is 10 this means that each character is going to be rendered with a speed of 500/10 = 50 ms.



**Instructions**
-
- There should be an input element with `id` **speed**
- For the text it should have an `id` as **text**.
